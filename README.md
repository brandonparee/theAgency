NAU CS399 Project 3

You run a small independent advertising agency (you may specialize in any manner of entertainment genre). Many of your advertising campaigns involve capturing data for your clients. For example, you might have a page where people fill out personal information to get a free T-Shirt, CD, or other merchandise as part of a contest. You might have another page where you can send a link to a friend (and in the process capture the sender and receiverâ€™s email). The name of the game is capturing information!
